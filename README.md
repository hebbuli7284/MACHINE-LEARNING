# MACHINE-LEARNING
Learning model of Ml
// Created by KARTHIK

/*Machine Learning visualized by KARTHIK

----Updates----
- Added speed slider
- Added batch slider (meaning how many times the result is used to train the AI)
- "Loading" bar while AI is being trained
- Added animation when AI chooses correctly

If AI makes same decision over and over when you have zero batch-number, you have to train it more!;-)

----Program explained----
The AI controls the blue box! The goal is that the blue box prevents the sphere from falling down.

As the code starts, the AI does many mistakes, but every time the loop runs, the AI becomes smarter.

After many iterations the AI will do close to NO mistake at all!

This is the power of machine learning. The machine learns!

I hope you like this machine learning visualization!

Note:
All input and corresponding output is stored into an array, and the code will most likely become slower after many iterations.

----Plans----
- Better graphics
